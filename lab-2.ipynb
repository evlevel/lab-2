Together, we will practice how to modify this program by adding a `''' '''` comment at the end of its source code containing the contents of your console session after running your program.  This content normally includes both the requested input you enter when running the program, along with its generated output.  You will copy and paste this content from your PyCharm console into this ''' ''' comment at the end of your .py file.
